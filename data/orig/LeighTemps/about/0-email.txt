Dear NODC

Weâ€™d be pleased if you could include our laboratory 40+ year sea temperature 
dataset and future updates in your data centre. We have published this online 
through our university repository to maximise its use.

The pre 2011 measurements were mostly taken by Jo Evans, the laboratory 
technician now retired, and are now managed by John Atkins. The published 
measurements were taken from a bucket lowered into the surface water using a 
calibrated mercury thermometer at about 9am each day. From 2013 they moved to a 
more frequent digital measurement in the lab seawater intake. A calibration was 
done and the difference was negligible.

Yours sincerely
Mark
